I wanted to create a basketball scoreboard that did some cool effects when interacting with the buttons on the page.
1. I want the background score board to animate into a short video when a shot is taking.
 so one point will be a free throw
 2. 2 points will be layup or dunk
 3. 3 points will be a 3 pointer.
I had alot of fun creating this project because of it been very interactive, and because my love for basketball.
